If you don't know what\r\nthe stuff in parentheses means, don't worry. It will be explained at our first\r\nclass meeting. \r\n\r\nThe paragraphs below serve as the syllabus for Sections 9--14 of Math 165.\r\n\r\n*This page, as well as the content directory above, and its subdirectories, will\r\n be updated throughout the semester, and students are expected to visit this\r\n page periodically.* \r\n\r\nPlease bookmark this page or, better yet,\r\n<a href=\"mailto:?subject=MATH 165 webpage&amp;body=The Math 165 webpage is\r\n http://github.com/williamdemeo/Math165-Spring2014\">email the url of this\r\n page to yourself!</a>\r\n\r\nThe ISU Blackboard system will be used only for recording test scores and\r\ngrades. Please Note, the Blackboard system often reports cumulative grade totals\r\nthat bear little relation to the course grades as they will be computed at\r\nthe end of the semester. If you want to find out where you stand in the class,\r\nplease keep track of your grades and refer to the\r\n[Grading Policy](#grading-policy) section below.\r\n\r\n\r\nClass Meeting Times\r\n-------------------\r\n**Lecture:** MWF 10--11:50am Carver Room 101  \r\n**Recitations:** Tuesdays at 9am or 10am or 12pm (depending on your section)  \r\n\r\n\r\nOverview, Prerequisites, Outcomes, Accessibility\r\n------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Overview**  \r\nWe will cover Chapters 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 of [the textbook](#textbook),\r\nwhich includes the following topics:\r\n- **2.** Limits and Continuity (~9 days)\r\n- **3.** Differentiation (~15 days)\r\n- **4.** Applications of Derivatives (~10 days)\r\n- **5.** Integration (~11 days)\r\n- **7.** Integrals and Transcendental Functions (~6 days)\r\n\r\nMore general information about Math 165 is found on the following pages:\r\n\r\n+ https://orion.math.iastate.edu/dept/calculus/\r\n+ http://orion.math.iastate.edu/dept/CoursePages/165-6/\r\n\r\nThe information at the link above applies not only to our section, but also\r\nto the other sections of Math 165.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Prerequisites**  \r\nStudents enrolled in Math 165 are expected to have taken a pre-calculus course,\r\nor some course in which you learned about:\r\n\r\n+ functions and their graphs\r\n+ trigonometry (sines, cosines, etc)\r\n+ exponential functions (2<sup>x</sup>, e<sup>x</sup>, etc)\r\n+ logarithms (ln(x) or log(x))\r\n\r\nYou will have a chance during the first few weeks of this semester to test yourself to\r\nmake sure you have the necessary background to succeed in the class.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Learning Outcomes**  \r\nGenerally speaking, students will master concepts and solve problems based on\r\nfunctions, limits, derivatives, introductory integrals, the Fundamental Theorem\r\nof Calculus, and applications of derivatives and integrals. For a more detailed\r\nlist of the course objectives, see\r\n\r\nhttps://orion.math.iastate.edu/dept/calculus/obj/objectives_Calc_I.html\r\n\r\n**Accessibility**  \r\nIf you have special needs as addressed by the Americans with Disabilities\r\nAct, or otherwise, and need any assistance please notify me immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTextbook\r\n--------\r\nWeir, Hass, *Thomas' Calculus*, Early Transcendentals, 12th Edition.\r\n\r\nThe [publisher's web page for our textbook](http://www.pearsonhighered.com/educator/product/Thomas-Calculus-Early-Transcendentals/9780321588760.page)\r\nis at the following url:\r\n\r\n[http://www.pearsonhighered.com/educator/product/Thomas-Calculus-Early-Transcendentals/9780321588760.page](http://www.pearsonhighered.com/educator/product/Thomas-Calculus-Early-Transcendentals/9780321588760.page)\r\n\r\n**Important Note:** It is highly recommended that you buy a hard copy of the\r\ntextbook and that you purchase a version that comes bundled with an access code\r\nfor the [MyLabsPlus][] online homework system. This will make it convenient\r\nto study from the book and complete the online homework assignments.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, it is possible to buy an access code for MyLabsPlus, either\r\ndirectly through the [MyLabsPlus website][] or from the university bookstore,\r\nwithout buying the textbook.  In fact, access to MyLabsPlus comes with a\r\n(somewhat restricted) electronic version of the textbook, so it is \r\nnot absolutely necessary to have a hard copy.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is helpful to have a hard copy, or at least an\r\nelectronic version that you can view on a tablet when studying in the library.\r\nIf you limit yourself to the electronic access provided through MyLabsPlus, you\r\nmay find it very inconvenient and, as a result, end up studying from the\r\ntextbook less often than if you had purchased a hard copy.\r\n\r\n\r\nExams\r\n-----\r\nThere will be two tests, one midterm exam, and one final exam.\r\n**Each test is worth 15%, the midterm is worth 20%, and the final exam is worth\r\n25% of the course grade.**\r\n\r\n+ **TEST 1** on Chapter 2  \r\n**TIME:** Tuesday, February 3 at your usual recitation meeting time.  \r\n**LOCATION:** in your usual recitation classroom.\r\n  \r\n+ **MIDTERM EXAM** on Chapter 2 and most of Chapter 3 (up to and including 3.8)   \r\n**TIME:** Wednesday, February 25, 8:15--9:45pm\t\r\n**LOCATION:** (to be announced)\r\n\r\n+ **TEST 2** on Sections 3.8 through 4.6 (except 4.2)  \r\n**TIME:** (to be announced)  \r\n**LOCATION:** (to be announced)\r\n\r\n+ **FINAL EXAM** (cumulative)  \r\n**TIME:** (to be announced)  \r\n**LOCATION:** (to be announced)\r\n\r\nThe final exam will be a common and cumulative exam; that is, all Math 165\r\nstudents take the same exam and it will cover everything we have learned during \r\nthe semester.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with university policy, the final exam is mandatory and must be\r\ntaken by all students at the scheduled time. Do not make travel plans before\r\nknowing the date of the final exam.\r\n\r\n[Math 165 exams from previous semesters](https://orion.math.iastate.edu/dept/calculus/exams/exams.html)\r\nare available, and it is strongly recommend that you make use of\r\nthem when preparing to take the exams in this class.  The best way to\r\nprepare for a math test is to practice solving many problems of the kind that\r\nmight appear on the test.\r\n\r\n(For your convenience, the old exams for Math 165 are also collected in the\r\n[exams/old_exams directory](exams/old_exams) of this GitHub repository.)\r\n\r\n\r\nQuizzes\r\n-------\r\nThere will be roughly 6 quizzes administered in the recitations sections.  Your\r\nbest 5 quiz scores will account for 5% of the final course grade.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnline Homework\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nSolving lots of problems is the best way to prepare yourself to do well on\r\nthe tests and quizzes in this class.\r\n\r\nThe **online homework will account for 20% of the course grade** and will be\r\nassigned about once or twice per week.\r\n\r\nAll homework for this course will be done online with the [MyLabsPlus][] (MLP) \r\nsystem. (More info on MLP below.)\r\nThe problems assigned and the due dates will be clearly indicated on the\r\nMyLabslast website, so students must login frequently and check for newly\r\nassigned homework. (The last assignment will be due during the last week\r\nof the semester, also known as \"dead week.\")  \r\n\r\n**Late homework will not be accepted or graded.**  \r\n\r\nThere will be between 15 and 20 online homework assignments during the semester.\r\nThe two lowest homework scores will not count toward your grade.\r\n\r\nRegistered students should be automatically enrolled in MyLabsPlus (MLP) and can \r\nget started by navigating to the [MyLabsPlus website][] and following the\r\n[MyLabsPlus Login Instructions](http://www.math.iastate.edu/Undergrad/MMLplusRegistration.pdf)\r\nprovided in the document posted at [www.math.iastate.edu/Undergrad/MMLplusRegistration.pdf](http://www.math.iastate.edu/Undergrad/MMLplusRegistration.pdf).\r\n\r\nMore information about MyLabsPlus is found in the [homework](homework) directory.\r\n\r\n\r\nHandwritten Homework\r\n--------------------\r\nTo get the most out of the homework, and to prepare yourself well for the in-class\r\n(hand-written) tests and exams, it is a very good idea to print out hard copies\r\nof each MLP assignment, to take these hard copies to a quiet place like the\r\nlibrary, and to work on them using a pencil.\r\nThereafter, you should go through the assignment from the beginning while logged into MLP\r\nand submit your answers, using your handwritten notes and solutions as a guide.  \r\n\r\nHand-written work will not be submitted for grading.\r\nHowever, for the purpose of asking questions about homework in lecture,\r\nrecitation section, or office hours, as well as for studying for exams, it can\r\nbe very helpful to have printed out hard copies of all the homework assignments.\r\n\r\n\r\nMake-up Policy\r\n--------------\r\n*There will be no make-up homework or exams.*\r\nIf you must miss an exam for a legitimate reason, contact the professor\r\nat least three days prior to the exam date and you might be allowed\r\nto take the exam *before* the scheduled exam time. \r\n\r\nIf you miss a test due to some unforeseen circumstance, you must contact the \r\nprofessor within one class meeting after the missed test and provide an\r\nexplanation. If your excuse is accepted, the missed test score may be replaced \r\nwith 80% of your final exam score. For example, if your excuse is accepted and\r\nyou score a 90% on the final, then you will receive a 72% for the missed test\r\n(0.80*0.90 = 0.72).\r\n\r\n\r\nGrading Policy\r\n--------------\r\nThe breakdown of the final course grade is as follows:  \r\n\r\n+ Final exam: 25 points  \r\n+ Mid-term exam: 20 points  \r\n+ Tests: 30 points total  \r\n+ Homework: 20 points total  \r\n+ Quizzes: 5 points\r\n\r\nAt the end of the semester, letter grades will be assigned roughly according to\r\nthe following table. However, the scale may be shifted,\r\ndepending on overall student performance.  All curving (if any)\r\nwill occur at the end of the semester.  \r\n\r\n+ A: 91--100  \r\n+ B+: 87--90   \r\n+ B: 84--86   \r\n+ B-: 81--83   \r\n+ C+: 77--80  \r\n+ C: 74--76   \r\n+ C-: 71--73   \r\n+ D+: 67--70   \r\n+ D: 64--66   \r\n+ D-: 60--63   \r\n+ F:  0--59    \r\n\r\nAttendance\r\n----------\r\nStudents are expected to attend all classes.\r\nA grade penalty will be exacted if you have an excessive number of absences\r\n(whether excused or unexcused).\r\nSpecifically, you are permitted (but strongly discouraged from taking) seven\r\nabsences in total. Each absence in addition\r\nto that may result in the deduction of points from your final grade.\r\n\r\n<!-- In most of the lectures, attendance will be recorded by passing around a sign-in -->\r\n<!-- sheet on which you will print and sign your own name. (If another student asks -->\r\n<!-- you to sign in for them, don't do it! Forging another student's signature -->\r\n<!-- constitutes a violation of the student code of conduct and will be referred to -->\r\n<!-- the ISU Office of Academic Integrity.) -->\r\n\r\nIf you plan to leave before class is over, the correct procedure is to mention\r\nthis to the professor before the start of class. It is impolite and disruptive\r\nto your classmates to leave, or even pack up your belongings, before the lecture\r\nis over.\r\n\r\n\r\nAsking Questions\r\n----------------\r\nWhen you don't understand something even after giving it some thought,\r\nplease ask a question!  The best time/place to do this is during lecture or\r\nrecitation or office hours.\r\n\r\nThe second best time/place to ask a question is on our [google groups Q&A forum](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/math165-spring2015).\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to post on our google groups forum:\r\n\r\n1. visit the page https://groups.google.com/d/forum/math165-spring2015 and\r\n   select \"Post a Question\", OR\r\n\r\n2. send your post via email using the\r\n   address [math165-spring2015 at googlegroups.com](mailto:math165-spring2015@googlegroups.com).\r\n\r\nAnother way to ask a question is by using the \"Ask my instructor\" link on\r\nMyLabsPlus. This method is most convenient for the instructor because\r\ndetails about the problem you're having trouble with are automatically embedded\r\nin your email.  *Please note:* if you use the \"Ask my instructor\" button, your\r\nquestion may appear on our google group forum (which is public).  If you're\r\nuncomfortable with this, please say so in your message.\r\n\r\nFinally, you may email the instructors directly, though the response\r\ntime might be slower than if you use one of the preferred methods above.\r\n\r\n\r\nUse of Electronics During Lecture\r\n---------------------------------\r\nSilence and refrain from using all electronic devices (phones, ipods, tablets,\r\nmicrowave ovens, etc.) during class and exam periods.  The only exception to\r\nthis policy is the use of computers or tablets for the purpose of referring to\r\nan electronic copy of the textbook, or the online (MyLabsPlus) homework\r\nproblems. Using a computer during lecture to check Facebook, for\r\nexample, is totally unacceptable. Besides how this affects your own ability to\r\nfocus on what is being taught in the lecture, computers can be very distracting \r\nto other students. **Use of electronic devices in lecture for purposes unrelated\r\nto calculus will not be tolerated.**\r\n\r\nSupplemental Instruction\r\n------------------------\r\nSupplemental Instruction (SI) is an internationally recognized academic support\r\nprogram offering free, regularly scheduled study sessions for traditionally\r\ndifficult courses. Attend once or attend every session...the choice is up to\r\nyou, but the data suggests that the more you attend, the higher your final grade\r\nwill be in the course. Students are encouraged to attend SI at least once per\r\nweek. More information is at https://apps-dso.sws.iastate.edu/si/\r\n\r\nAcademic Honesty\r\n----------------\r\nCheating will not be tolerated. Violations of this policy will be referred to\r\nand dealt with by the ISU Office of Academic Integrity, in a  manner consistent\r\nwith university regulations, which range from a warning to expulsion from the\r\nuniversity.\r\n\r\n\r\nDisabilities Statement\r\n----------------------\r\nIf you believe that you have a disability that qualifies under the\r\nAmericans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation\r\nAct and requires accommodations, you should contact the Student Disability\r\nResources Office for information on appropriate policies and procedures. \r\nThe Disability Resources Office is located in the Student Services\r\nBuilding, Room 1076; phone number: 515-294-7220. The next step is to\r\nsee me. I am happy to assist with accommodations, but I will not\r\nprovide them retroactively (so file the appropriate requests and paperwork \r\nbefore the first exam!).\r\n\r\nClassroom Policy\r\n----------------\r\nIn this course, we follow the general university classroom policy: http://www.math.iastate.edu/Faculty/ClassPolicies.html\r\n\r\nAdditional Resources\r\n--------------------\r\n+ [MyLabsPlus][]\r\n+ [Math 165 General Info](https://orion.math.iastate.edu/dept/calculus/)\r\n+ [Another General Info page](http://orion.math.iastate.edu/dept/CoursePages/165-6/)\r\n+ [ISU Math Department](http://www.math.iastate.edu/)\r\n+ [ISU Math Course Pages](http://www.math.iastate.edu/Directories/CoursePages.html)\r\n+ [Math 165 Exams from prior semesters](https://orion.math.iastate.edu/dept/calculus/exams/exams.html)\r\n  \r\n[MyLabsPlus]: http://www.iastate.mylabsplus.com\r\n[MyLabsPlus website]: http://www.iastate.mylabsplus.com\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
