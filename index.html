<a id="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>You are now reading the main course web page (which is simply a README.md
file in a GitHub repository called Math165-Spring2015).  If you don't know what
the stuff in parentheses means, don't worry. It will be explained at our first
class meeting. </p>

<p>The paragraphs below serve as the syllabus for Sections 9--14 of Math 165.</p>

<p><em>This page, as well as the content directory above, and its subdirectories, will
 be updated throughout the semester, and students are expected to visit this
 page periodically.</em> </p>

<p>Please bookmark this page or, better yet,
<a href="mailto:?subject=MATH%20165%20webpage&amp;body=The%20Math%20165%20webpage%20is%0A%20http://github.com/williamdemeo/Math165-Spring2014">email the url of this
 page to yourself!</a></p>

<p>The ISU Blackboard system will be used only for recording test scores and
grades. Please Note, the Blackboard system often reports cumulative grade totals
that bear little relation to the course grades as they will be computed at
the end of the semester. If you want to find out where you stand in the class,
please keep track of your grades and refer to the
<a href="#grading-policy">Grading Policy</a> section below.</p>

<li><a href="http://orion.math.iastate.edu/dept/CoursePages/165-6/">http://orion.math.iastate.edu/dept/CoursePages/165-6/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The information at the link above applies not only to our section, but also
to the other sections of Math 165.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong><br>
Students enrolled in Math 165 are expected to have taken a pre-calculus course,
or some course in which you learned about:</p>

<ul>
<li>functions and their graphs</li>
<li>trigonometry (sines, cosines, etc)</li>
<li>exponential functions (2<sup>x</sup>, e<sup>x</sup>, etc)</li>
<li>logarithms (ln(x) or log(x))</li>
</ul>

<p>You will have a chance during the first few weeks of this semester to test yourself to
make sure you have the necessary background to succeed in the class.</p>

<p><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><br>
Generally speaking, students will master concepts and solve problems based on
functions, limits, derivatives, introductory integrals, the Fundamental Theorem
of Calculus, and applications of derivatives and integrals. For a more detailed
list of the course objectives, see</p>

<p><a href="https://orion.math.iastate.edu/dept/calculus/obj/objectives_Calc_I.html">https://orion.math.iastate.edu/dept/calculus/obj/objectives_Calc_I.html</a></p>

<p><strong>Accessibility</strong><br>

Act, or otherwise, and need any assistance please notify me immediately.</p>

<h2>
<a id="textbook" class="anchor" href="#textbook" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Textbook</h2>

<p>Weir, Hass, <em>Thomas' Calculus</em>, Early Transcendentals, 12th Edition.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.pearsonhighered.com/educator/product/Thomas-Calculus-Early-Transcendentals/9780321588760.page">publisher's web page for our textbook</a>
is at the following url:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pearsonhighered.com/educator/product/Thomas-Calculus-Early-Transcendentals/9780321588760.page">http://www.pearsonhighered.com/educator/product/Thomas-Calculus-Early-Transcendentals/9780321588760.page</a></p>

<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> It is highly recommended that you buy a hard copy of the
textbook and that you purchase a version that comes bundled with an access code
for the <a href="http://www.iastate.mylabsplus.com">MyLabsPlus</a> online homework system. This will make it convenient
to study from the book and complete the online homework assignments.</p>

<p>Having said that, it is possible to buy an access code for MyLabsPlus, either
directly through the <a href="http://www.iastate.mylabsplus.com">MyLabsPlus website</a> or from the university bookstore,
without buying the textbook.  In fact, access to MyLabsPlus comes with a
(somewhat restricted) electronic version of the textbook, so it is 
not absolutely necessary to have a hard copy.</p>

<p>However, it is helpful to have a hard copy, or at least an
electronic version that you can view on a tablet when studying in the library.
If you limit yourself to the electronic access provided through MyLabsPlus, you
may find it very inconvenient and, as a result, end up studying from the
textbook less often than if you had purchased a hard copy.</p>

<h2>
<a id="exams" class="anchor" href="#exams" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Exams</h2>

<p>There will be two tests, one midterm exam, and one final exam.
<strong>Each test is worth 15%, the midterm is worth 20%, and the final exam is worth
25% of the course grade.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>TEST 1</strong> on Chapter 2<br>
<strong>TIME:</strong> Tuesday, February 3 at your usual recitation meeting time.<br>
<strong>LOCATION:</strong> in your usual recitation classroom.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MIDTERM EXAM</strong> on Chapter 2 and most of Chapter 3 (up to and including 3.8)<br>
<strong>TIME:</strong> Wednesday, February 25, 8:15--9:45pm<br>
<strong>LOCATION:</strong> (to be announced)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TEST 2</strong> on Sections 3.8 through 4.6 (except 4.2)<br>
<strong>TIME:</strong> (to be announced)<br>
<strong>LOCATION:</strong> (to be announced)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>FINAL EXAM</strong> (cumulative)<br>
<strong>TIME:</strong> (to be announced)<br>
<strong>LOCATION:</strong> (to be announced)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The final exam will be a common and cumulative exam; that is, all Math 165
students take the same exam and it will cover everything we have learned during 
the semester.</p>

<p>In accordance with university policy, the final exam is mandatory and must be
taken by all students at the scheduled time. Do not make travel plans before
knowing the date of the final exam.</p>

<p><a href="https://orion.math.iastate.edu/dept/calculus/exams/exams.html">Math 165 exams from previous semesters</a>
are available, and it is strongly recommend that you make use of
them when preparing to take the exams in this class.  The best way to
prepare for a math test is to practice solving many problems of the kind that
might appear on the test.</p>

<p>(For your convenience, the old exams for Math 165 are also collected in the
<a href="exams/old_exams">exams/old_exams directory</a> of this GitHub repository.)</p>

<h2>
<a id="quizzes" class="anchor" href="#quizzes" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Quizzes</h2>

<p>There will be roughly 6 quizzes administered in the recitations sections.  Your
best 5 quiz scores will account for 5% of the final course grade.</p>

<h2>
<a id="online-homework" class="anchor" href="#online-homework" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Online Homework</h2>

<p>Solving lots of problems is the best way to prepare yourself to do well on
the tests and quizzes in this class.</p>

<p>The <strong>online homework will account for 20% of the course grade</strong> and will be
assigned about once or twice per week.</p>

<p>All homework for this course will be done online with the <a href="http://www.iastate.mylabsplus.com">MyLabsPlus</a> (MLP) 
system. (More info on MLP below.)
The problems assigned and the due dates will be clearly indicated on the
MyLabslast website, so students must login frequently and check for newly
assigned homework. (The last assignment will be due during the last week
of the semester, also known as "dead week.")  </p>

<p><strong>Late homework will not be accepted or graded.</strong>  </p>

<p>There will be between 15 and 20 online homework assignments during the semester.
The two lowest homework scores will not count toward your grade.</p>

<p>Registered students should be automatically enrolled in MyLabsPlus (MLP) and can 
get started by navigating to the <a href="http://www.iastate.mylabsplus.com">MyLabsPlus website</a> and following the
<a href="http://www.math.iastate.edu/Undergrad/MMLplusRegistration.pdf">MyLabsPlus Login Instructions</a>
provided in the document posted at <a href="http://www.math.iastate.edu/Undergrad/MMLplusRegistration.pdf">www.math.iastate.edu/Undergrad/MMLplusRegistration.pdf</a>.</p>

<p>More information about MyLabsPlus is found in the <a href="homework">homework</a> directory.</p>

<h2>
<a id="handwritten-homework" class="anchor" href="#handwritten-homework" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Handwritten Homework</h2>

<p>To get the most out of the homework, and to prepare yourself well for the in-class
(hand-written) tests and exams, it is a very good idea to print out hard copies
of each MLP assignment, to take these hard copies to a quiet place like the
library, and to work on them using a pencil.
Thereafter, you should go through the assignment from the beginning while logged into MLP
and submit your answers, using your handwritten notes and solutions as a guide.  </p>

<p>Hand-written work will not be submitted for grading.
However, for the purpose of asking questions about homework in lecture,
recitation section, or office hours, as well as for studying for exams, it can
be very helpful to have printed out hard copies of all the homework assignments.</p>

<h2>
<a id="make-up-policy" class="anchor" href="#make-up-policy" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Make-up Policy</h2>

<p><em>There will be no make-up homework or exams.</em>
If you must miss an exam for a legitimate reason, contact the professor
at least three days prior to the exam date and you might be allowed
to take the exam <em>before</em> the scheduled exam time. </p>

<p>If you miss a test due to some unforeseen circumstance, you must contact the 
professor within one class meeting after the missed test and provide an
explanation. If your excuse is accepted, the missed test score may be replaced 
with 80% of your final exam score. For example, if your excuse is accepted and
you score a 90% on the final, then you will receive a 72% for the missed test
(0.80*0.90 = 0.72).</p>

<h2>
<a id="grading-policy" class="anchor" href="#grading-policy" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Grading Policy</h2>

<p>The breakdown of the final course grade is as follows:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Final exam: 25 points<br>
</li>
<li>Mid-term exam: 20 points<br>
</li>
<li>Tests: 30 points total<br>
</li>
<li>Homework: 20 points total<br>
</li>
<li>Quizzes: 5 points</li>
</ul>

<p>At the end of the semester, letter grades will be assigned roughly according to
the following table. However, the scale may be shifted,
depending on overall student performance.  All curving (if any)
will occur at the end of the semester.  </p>

<ul>
<li>A: 91--100<br>
</li>
<li>B+: 87--90<br>
</li>
<li>B: 84--86<br>
</li>
<li>B-: 81--83<br>
</li>
<li>C+: 77--80<br>
</li>
<li>C: 74--76<br>
</li>
<li>C-: 71--73<br>
</li>
<li>D+: 67--70<br>
</li>
<li>D: 64--66<br>
</li>
<li>D-: 60--63<br>
</li>
<li>F:  0--59<br>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="attendance" class="anchor" href="#attendance" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Attendance</h2>

<p>Students are expected to attend all classes.
A grade penalty will be exacted if you have an excessive number of absences
(whether excused or unexcused).
Specifically, you are permitted (but strongly discouraged from taking) seven
absences in total. Each absence in addition
to that may result in the deduction of points from your final grade.</p>











<p>If you plan to leave before class is over, the correct procedure is to mention
this to the professor before the start of class. It is impolite and disruptive
to your classmates to leave, or even pack up your belongings, before the lecture
is over.</p>

<h2>
<a id="asking-questions" class="anchor" href="#asking-questions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Asking Questions</h2>

<p>When you don't understand something even after giving it some thought,
please ask a question!  The best time/place to do this is during lecture or
recitation or office hours.</p>

<p>The second best time/place to ask a question is on our <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/math165-spring2015">google groups Q&amp;A forum</a>.</p>

<p>There are two ways to post on our google groups forum:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>visit the page <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/math165-spring2015">https://groups.google.com/d/forum/math165-spring2015</a> and
select "Post a Question", OR</p></li>
<li><p>send your post via email using the
address <a href="mailto:math165-spring2015@googlegroups.com">math165-spring2015 at googlegroups.com</a>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Another way to ask a question is by using the "Ask my instructor" link on
MyLabsPlus. This method is most convenient for the instructor because
details about the problem you're having trouble with are automatically embedded
in your email.  <em>Please note:</em> if you use the "Ask my instructor" button, your
question may appear on our google group forum (which is public).  If you're
uncomfortable with this, please say so in your message.</p>

<p>Finally, you may email the instructors directly, though the response
time might be slower than if you use one of the preferred methods above.</p>

<h2>
<a id="use-of-electronics-during-lecture" class="anchor" href="#use-of-electronics-during-lecture" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Use of Electronics During Lecture</h2>

<p>Silence and refrain from using all electronic devices (phones, ipods, tablets,
microwave ovens, etc.) during class and exam periods.  The only exception to
this policy is the use of computers or tablets for the purpose of referring to
an electronic copy of the textbook, or the online (MyLabsPlus) homework
problems. Using a computer during lecture to check Facebook, for
example, is totally unacceptable. Besides how this affects your own ability to
focus on what is being taught in the lecture, computers can be very distracting 
to other students. <strong>Use of electronic devices in lecture for purposes unrelated
to calculus will not be tolerated.</strong></p>

<h2>
<a id="supplemental-instruction" class="anchor" href="#supplemental-instruction" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Supplemental Instruction</h2>

<p>Supplemental Instruction (SI) is an internationally recognized academic support
program offering free, regularly scheduled study sessions for traditionally
difficult courses. Attend once or attend every session...the choice is up to
you, but the data suggests that the more you attend, the higher your final grade
will be in the course. Students are encouraged to attend SI at least once per
week. More information is at <a href="https://apps-dso.sws.iastate.edu/si/">https://apps-dso.sws.iastate.edu/si/</a></p>

<h2>
<a id="academic-honesty" class="anchor" href="#academic-honesty" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Academic Honesty</h2>

<p>Cheating will not be tolerated. Violations of this policy will be referred to
and dealt with by the ISU Office of Academic Integrity, in a  manner consistent
with university regulations, which range from a warning to expulsion from the
university.</p>

<h2>
<a id="disabilities-statement" class="anchor" href="#disabilities-statement" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Disabilities Statement</h2>

<p>If you believe that you have a disability that qualifies under the
Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation
Act and requires accommodations, you should contact the Student Disability
Resources Office for information on appropriate policies and procedures. 
The Disability Resources Office is located in the Student Services
Building, Room 1076; phone number: 515-294-7220. The next step is to
see me. I am happy to assist with accommodations, but I will not
provide them retroactively (so file the appropriate requests and paperwork 
before the first exam!).</p>
